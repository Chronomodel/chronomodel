\b\fs32 Preamble\par
\fs24\par
\b0 The purpose of this Free Software license agreement is to grant users the right to modify and redistribute the software governed by this license within the framework of an open source distribution model.\par
The exercising of this right is conditional upon certain obligations for users so as to preserve this status for all subsequent redistributions.\par
In consideration of access to the source code and the rights to copy, modify and redistribute granted by the license, users are provided only with a limited warranty and the software's author, the holder of the economic rights, and the successive licensors only have limited liability.\par
In this respect, the risks associated with loading, using, modifying and/or developing or reproducing the software by the user are brought to the user's attention, given its Free Software status, which may make it complicated to use, with the result that its use is reserved for developers and experienced professionals having in-depth computer knowledge. Users are therefore encouraged to load and test the suitability of the software as regards their requirements in conditions enabling the security of their systems and/or data to be ensured and, more generally, to use and operate it in the same conditions of security. This Agreement may be freely reproduced and published, provided it is not altered, and that no provisions are either added or removed herefrom.\par
This Agreement may apply to any or all software for which the holder of the economic rights decides to submit the use thereof to its provisions.\par
Frequently asked questions can be found on the official website of the CeCILL licenses family ({\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.cecill.info/licences/%3Ehttp://www.cecill.info/index.en.html"}}{\fldrslt{http://www.cecill.info/index.en.html}}}\f0\fs24 ) for any necessary clarification.\par

\par
\b\fs32 Article 9 - WARRANTY\fs24\par

The Licensee shall be responsible for verifying, by any or all means, the suitability of the product for its requirements, its good working order, and for ensuring that it shall not cause damage to either persons or properties.\par
9.2 The Licensor hereby represents, in good faith, that it is entitled to grant all the rights over the Software (including in particular the rights set forth in Article {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.cecill.info/licences/Licence_CeCILL_V2.1-en.html#scope"}}{\fldrslt{5}}}\f0\fs24 ).\par

Nevertheless, should such proceedings be instituted against the Licensee, the Licensor shall provide it with technical and legal expertise for its defense.

11.3 The Agreement cancels and replaces any or all previous agreements, whether written or oral, between the Parties and having the same purpose, and constitutes the entirety of the agreement between said Parties concerning said purpose.
